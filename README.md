My first big project, a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and an attempt at a rudimentary AI done in the second half of my first programming class. 

Offers two games modes: 
- Easy, which pits you against a random generator, 
- Hard, which pits you against an AI that will attempt to outwit you. 

Start the game by running "Main" class.
